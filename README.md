# Image-Recognition-System

A deep learning model is built for image recognition using Keras library. The model consists of CNN layers, Max pooling layers, Dropout layers, and Dense layers. It is able to predict the images with accuracies ranging from 40%-98%, which is trained with CIFAR-10 dataset. 

> File 'Img_Recognition-2.ipynb' contains trained model. The trained model is been tested at file 'Trained_Model_ImgRecg.ipynb'. 
> 'Trained_Model_ImgRecg.ipynb' file is executed to test different images.
> 'weights_model.h5' contains the weights of the model and 'struct_model.json' contains structure of the model.
